# Use a static value for `PATH` and does not inherit `LD_LIBRARY_PATH`. Doesn't let environment
# variables like `PATH` sneak into the build, which can cause massive cache misses when they change.
# Use `--action_env=ENV_VARIABLE` if you want to inherit specific environment variables from the
# client, but note that doing so can prevent cross-user caching if a shared cache is used.
